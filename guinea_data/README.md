Please help digitize these data! It only takes about 10-15 minutes per sheet. 
* Pick a file from the undigitized_PDFs folder, visit [this google spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/ebola_guinea) 
* Fill in the table. If the date is missing from the Google Spreadsheet, just duplicate an existing sheet. 
* Optional: send me an email or a tweet so I know there is new data to put on github.
